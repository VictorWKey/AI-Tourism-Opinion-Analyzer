"Crowded, but worthwhile if you can tolerate the cattle line jostling","The museum is what it is, an interesting place that is so crowded with visitors that it is uncomfortable. I don’t read Spanish well so details were lost on me, but I’ve read a biography on Kahlo so I got the gist. HOWEVER, this review is mostly to caution people against booking through TA. For a few weeks the time was 1:30 pm. The day before the event I got an alert that it was 1 pm. We got to the museum early to avoid traffic, wait in line and BOOM the ticket wranglers tell us it’s for 1:30, not 1. So back in the cattle line we go.I’m glad I went— I liked seeing the house and several objects and paintings, but I will never want to go again. Also, i will never book anything through TA again (I had a negative experience regarding time with a booking yesterday, too). Happy travels.",,2,,,sept de 2025
Experiencia inmersiva y diferente sobre Frida Kahlo,"La visita fue una experiencia distinta: nos tocó una representación en vivo de la vida de Frida Kahlo. El lugar estaba muy lleno, tanto que en ocasiones apenas podíamos ver bien mientras caminábamos junto con la experiencia. Sin embargo, la actriz que interpreta a Frida es excelente y transmite mucha autenticidad. A pesar de la multitud, sin duda fue una experiencia agradable y recomendable para quienes quieran vivir algo diferente.",,5,"Los Cabos, México",,ago de 2025
Super cool experience,"This was very cool. My favorite part was the special exhibit of Frida’s dresses, which I’m not sure are there all the time! A great experience overall, especially if you are a fan. I was only sad that they don’t let you take photos in the house, which was disappointing since they have a few of her works.",,5,"Madison, WI",,ago de 2025
Must see museum,"A special museum. Need to visit when in Mexico, if only a slightly interested in history and mystery about this iconic museum.",,4,,,ago de 2025
Sitio imperdible cuando visites Ciudad de México CDMX,"Maravillosa experiencia, te permite conocer los espacios y rincones habitados por Frida Kahlo, te transportas en el tiempo.",,5,"Zapopan, México",,sept de 2024
Great experience for Frida and art lovers!,"Loved this trip! It was about a half hour Uber ride from Roma Norte. I bought my ticket online, about 3 weeks in advance. The tickets were mailed to us and I easily pulled them up on my phone.  We showed up 15 minutes in advance and there was a line. I did a self guided tour and we spent about 2 hours on the grounds. I was able to see all the spaces and if you want to eat in the cafe, give yourself some more time. We went walking to the Mercado de Coyoacán afterwards to eat!",,5,"Chicago, IL",,jul de 2025
Tips for visiting Casa Azul,"Must-do for Mexico City. So many interesting pieces from Frida's life to be found here. Definitely book your ticket in advance online. We went on a Tuesday and by 11 am, all entries until 4 pm were sold out. Luckily, we had booked our tickets online 2 weeks earlier but even then, time slots only had 1 or 2 available spots left. There are good souvenir kiosks outside the museum but they require cash. There are nice souvenirs inside but they get picked over quick and seem to take a while to replenish due to the crowds. A great art studio right next door to the museum too. (Can't recall the name.) The entryway alone is a fabulous photo-op but upstairs there are lots of interesting crafts, jewelry, art, etc that aren't super expensive. They will tell you all about how the pieces were made.Getting a photo at Casa Azul without randoms standing in the background is hard considering how packed it was. There is a small drink cart inside the grounds and lots of sitting areas so plan to have a drink and relax for a while within the blue walls after visiting the museum/ home.",,4,"Woodbury, MN",,jun de 2025
Must visit when visiting CDMX,"This was such a wonderful place to visit, it was great to walk through the house & see all of her artwork. The house itself is a piece of art. Definitely book in advance as it sells out. Also really enjoyed the exhibition featuring some of Frida’s dresses and clothing. Quick easy uber ride from CDMX.",,5,"Los Ángeles, CA",,may de 2025
Wonderful place to personally connect with Mexico’s most famous artist.,"A great musuem to explore the beauty and tragedy of Mexico’s most celebrated modern artist. Frida Kahlo grew up in this home and having survived polio, she had her right leg amputated after a tragic bus accident. The museum carefully displays 21 of her more minor works but gives a wonderful narrative of her life, politics, and marriage to Diego Rivera. This exhibit also includes personal items including the bed (with suspended mirror) that she used to construct her self portraits as well as the room where she passed away. A newer addition to the collection is some of her wonderful clothes that were discovered in the house in 2007. Pre-book your tickets in advance is essential for entry.",,5,"Londres, UK",,may de 2025
Tips for exporting the museum,"We bought our tickets about 49 days in advance and would recommend to get the first slot in the morning (10 AM) to beat the crowds. People start lining up about 15-30 minutes before their scheduled time. You cannot go at another time, you have to go at the time stated on your ticket. We had printed tickets and saved a screenshot in our phones. The QR code ticket screenshot in our phones were read easier than the printed version. Make sure you see the last part of the museum! After Frida Kahlo's death in 1954, her husband Diego Rivera had her belongings stored in a bathroom at their home, and ordered it to remain locked until 15 years after his own death. The room was opened in 2004, fifty years after it was sealed and the contents are showcased in that last area.",,5,,,abr de 2025
An Oasis of calm.,"An oasis of calm within Frida’s home and studio. Showcasing her art and costumes. Plus where she painted, cooked and slept.",,4,"Newmarket, UK",,dic de 2024
un pedazo de historia,"la casa con una gran historia de los pintores, muy recomendable si te gusta el arte moderno, considera que el lugar tiene bastantes escaleras y no hay elevador la accesibilidad puede ser limitada para algunas personas, tiene una cafetería muy pequeña y con poca oferta considera salir a comer a otro lugar, la tiene de recuerdos poco surtida",,5,"Guadalajara, México",,mar de 2025
Graceland for Frida Fans.,"A must visit, bucket list, place for any fan of Frida, and to a lesser extent, Diego.It is extremely well managed and maintained. Although the number of visitors is managed (and quite rightly), some of it still feels very intimate.A beautiful place to spend a few hours, especially if you can just sit and enjoy some time in the peaceful garden area.Highly recommend and must see thing to do in Mexico City.",,5,"Wicklow, Irlanda",,mar de 2025
Book in advance,"Please book a timed ticket in advance as only way to visit the house where Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera lived. Very authentic with some art works on display, but mainly how Frida lived. A very worthwhile visit",,4,"Wellington, Nueva Zelanda",,nov de 2024
Amazing !,"Really great museum! Even if you know Frida Khalo’s life and art, visiting her house is super valuable. It’s a beautiful place and very interesting to see how she lived. It’s very well kept and even if it’s always sold out it’s not too busy inside.It isn’t huge but it’s nice to be able to sit and take in the atmosphere in the gardens.I am disabled and was able to enter for free as per their policy. There are a lot of steps sadly but some ramps too.",,5,"Londres, UK",,mar de 2025
Tourist Trap. Skip it!,Don't waste your my time and money! Very few Frida artifacts. Mostly souvenir shops/refreshment vendors.  Learn more by watching the Frida documentary.,,2,,,feb de 2025
Amazing,Es un lugar que muestra más de lo que se espera! Tiene colecciones hermosas y cada rincón de la casa supera las expectativas.,,5,"Ciudad de México, México",,feb de 2025
Muy interesante,"“Es un lugar bonito y significativo que refleja la vida y obra de Frida Kahlo, además de mostrar aspectos importantes de su historia personal y artística. Sin embargo, no cuenta con algunas de sus pinturas más famosas, lo que podría decepcionar a ciertos visitantes.”",,4,"Bogotá, Colombia",,ene de 2025
Plan early.. but worth the trip,"Very enjoyable.  The house itself was so interesting to visit.. and walking through it, one really gets a sense of Frida Khalo as a a person and artist.",,5,"New Haven, CT",,dic de 2024
Afternoon in Coyoacan,Beautiful Museum!  Great insight into her life and her work.  Fun neighborhood to walk around.  We were there on a Saturday afternoon and there were many street vendors set up at the nearby Jardin Hidalgo and Jardin Centenario.,,5,,,dic de 2024
Impressed,"As an art lover and admirer of Frida it was the first place I visited in the city.  Definitely worth visiting.  I was expecting a crush of people and vendors but it was not like that. The flow of people was well organized , not crowded and the area was really nice and not at all commercialized.   We decided to get there early because the traffic is so heavy and enjoyed fresh juices at a sidewalk cafe while we waited. Must buy tickets in advance.",,5,"Cayo Ambergris, Belice",,dic de 2024
Arte que Inspira y Emociona,"En el barrio de Coyoacán, Ciudad de México, el Museo Frida Kahlo, conocido como La Casa Azul, es un espacio único donde la vida y obra de la icónica artista cobran vida. Sus pinturas, exhibidas con gran cuidado, destacan por su vibrante colorido, simbolismo y emotividad, convirtiéndose en el principal atractivo del lugar. Obras como Viva la Vida y sus autorretratos cautivan por su belleza y profundidad. Más que un museo, es una experiencia cultural que combina arte, historia y la esencia de México en cada rincón.",,4,"Lima, Perú",,ago de 2024
Fridas life? Sort of. Artwork? Less so.,"So if you’re a mega fan or a member of the Cult of Frida (which is a thing as far as I can tell) then this is a cool experience. You get to walk through the house where she lived most of her life with and without Diego.  But, if you’re just a mid range fan (which I admittedly am) you may feel a little short changed. There are a handful (a small handful at that) of Frida’s paintings. Like 4 or 5? So not much “art” when you think of a museum dedicated to a famous artist. But the other stuff - living quarters, her various medical recovery implements, even some of her clothes - are interesting enough. Just lot sure why this is the toughest museum ticket in CDMX. Take a pre tour - without it, the small museum would have been lest interesting.",,3,"Atlanta, GA",,nov de 2024
Very popular destination,"Don’t be late for your assigned time! Don’t let the long line concern you. Groups of ten are allowed in every few minutes. Since the entrance includes important info to read, it gets too crowded to read the material.  This s a design and flow error that needs correction to increase enjoyment and improve visitor experience.Once through that cluster, the situation improves. The compound has large, lush interior gardens open to the sky.  The rooms include original items and furnishings. It is wonderful to see Frida’s beautiful outfits, always long due to polio and a lower limb amputation after a serious accident.It is heartbreaking to see her surgical corsets and partial body casts, her wheelchair poised before her easel, and her leg brace.",,4,,,nov de 2024
Be sure to visit when in Mexico City,"Visiting the Frida Kahlo museum is a definite ""must do"" when visiting Mexico City. The house and compound themselves are breathtakingly beautiful. The content of the house is fascinating and so very interesting - an homage to an extraordinary woman and artist. Be sure to buy tickets in advance.",,5,"Boston, MA",,nov de 2024
Like traveling back in time,"This is an amazing place to visit. It is like traveling back in time and be part of her day to day life. The house is kept in its original condition and also features original Frida’s paintings. Due to it’s popularity all tickets get sold online and run out quickly, so, plan ahead.",,5,"Puerto Peñasco, México",,nov de 2024
"Museo Frida Kahlo, Mexico City in October","Book in advance! We turned up thinking we could stroll in on a Sunday in October but next available date was the Tuesday. Easy enough to book online though, you book a time , you get a 15 minute window if you are late, and once in courtyard you go through with your timed group where you can then go off at own pace. The museum was ok, but you need to be a big fan to appreciate everything. The gardens were relaxing to sit in, the gift shop was not very good, there was another gift shop stall by exit which had some other bits. Also by the exit was the dress museum which I found more interesting than the house.",,3,"Kent, UK",,oct de 2024
Great House Museum,"You come to this museum if you are interested in learning about the Great Mexican painter Frida Kalho and the world famous painter Diego Rivera her husband.  When Frida died her house that she shared with Diego for 25 years was opened  to the public.  A visit here requires advance purchased tickets and because the house rooms are small, timed entrances.   When you come you are directed through the rooms of her/their house and then into the gardens.  In a separate area there is another small exhibition area where Frida’s clothes are displayed.  There is also a small snack shop on the property.  As Frida and Diego spent so much time here and were international figures with many friends, the house reflects so much of their personality.  We spent 1.5 hours here.  The tickets you purchase (seniors get free entrance), also allow you to visit for free the Museo Anachuacalli.  Anachuacalli is a museum built by Diego and Frida to house his collection of Precolumbian Art.  The art collection is good but the museum architecture is the real reason for a visit.  Built like a temple building you might find at Teotihucan, it is quite unique and provides a view over Mexico City.   If you are staying in downtown Mexico City, keep in mind that the Khalo house (aka Casa Azul) is 25 minutes away in Coyacan and the Anachuacalli is 13 minutes by car further out of town.  So if you wish to do both, plan on doing so in one day.  Lastly, if you are a history buff don’t miss the Leon Trotsky house which is a few blocks away from the Khalo House.  Leon Trotsky was assassinated in his house and it can be visited.",,5,"Nipomo, CA",,sept de 2024
Nada que ver en este lugar.,"Caro y sin chiste. Frida era una muy mala artista pero le han dado un hype increíble e inmerecido. el lugar es pequeño, lo recorres en media hora y siempre esta atiborrado de extranjeros. un lugar caótico y caro.PD. mejor vayan al Museo Anahuacalli si quieren ver arte de verdad.",,1,,,oct de 2023

"Vayan a verlo, vale la pena.","Muchos objetos que pertenecieron a la pintora, pero pocos cuadros. Uno ahi puede ver el caracter excepcional que tenia Frida, lo que sufrio durante su vida debido a la polio y al accidente.",,4,"Montevideo, Uruguay",,may de 2024
An eccentric Icon,"The museum demands pre.online ticket booking. On the spot tickets are impossible to get. Even with prior appointment, 15-30 minutes of wait is possible. It has lots of items: family photos, school progress reports, newspaper articles, beds, clothes and dresses, crutches and vessels. Amidst all these are just a few surreal paintings of real beauty. They speak for the talent of the artist, condone the stories of hysterics, malingerings and peculiarities. ",,4,"Mumbai (Bombay), India",,may de 2024

Mexican feminist is renowned artist,"Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) was eminent Mexican artist who married Diego Rivero, a famous painter. Frida Kahlo is known for her self-portraits and her paintings of natural Mexican subjects. Frida Kahlo is known for her unique beauty; she suffered from polio and accidents but emerged as one of the great feminist artists of the 20th Century. Many of her works are held in public collections in Mexico and overseas.",,5,"Essendon, Australia",,feb de 2024

Freda Kahlo Museum,"I enjoyed reading the information and visiting the home they shared, but was happy the  price for admission was not expensive.  It takes about an hour to go thru and their gift shop is very small with little to interest any Kahlo follower.I enjoyed the mercado down the street more and enjoyed dinner at the market as well. Wonderful street food.",,3,"Houston, TX",,abr de 2024
Over rated and hard to schedule a visit for a group,"Over rated and hard to schedule a visit for a group. Their system only lets you get 5 tickets. And we were a group of 6. We had to buy tickets for two different times. And the website does not tell you can use the earlier ticket at the later time. We bought 5 tickets for 3:15 and we had to buy one for 3:45.   They would not let all 6 of us go in together as a group and wanted one of us to go at 3:45.  And the people working the line etc were acting all mighty about it. It is basically a system to control how many people are walking the place. Not a pleasant experience.  Maybe if you are a die hard artist you would have to go.  This was by a far for us a time not well spent.  There are more entertaining museums, parks and events. Waste of my money.They were letting other people just go in with the same issue but they were with a guide.  A rigged system.",,1,"Los Ángeles, CA",,abr de 2024
Quintessential Mexico City spot!,"Highly recommend taking a tour with this site, so you have some background context to the house and life of Frida Kahlo. Trust, it will impact the way you take in the house! Exhibits are well done and powerful. The location, in the neighborhood of Coyoacán, is spectacular. There’s a lot of food, artisans, and monuments to explore in this area - you could spend the whole day checking out various markets and sites!",,5,"Austin, TX",,abr de 2024
